### Ideas

Game will be moving on a map, having random encounters, making choices on a rich storyline, gathering new characters and cards, fighting foes based on the first version of the game
Info from PNJ or exploration to display the real ones
No points on the map. Just general directions.
Difficulty will be also based on the time the player have to finish an action

### First version

? - (Can zoom in to see a region including POIs and an avatar)
? - (Have a path to walk in to a next POI)
1 - Display an hex tiles map
2 - Display an avatar on the map and make it move by sliding onto the clicked slide
3 - Implement a fog of war on non visited tiles
4 - Start a dialogue with an NPC
5 - Choice includes to recruit the NPC
6 - Based on the choice, the next fight will be hard or easy
7 - Having a choice to make that would lead to 2 different fights
8 - Having different outcomes based on the result of the fight
